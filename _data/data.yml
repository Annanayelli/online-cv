        As Vice President of Community Outreach, I worked closely with my team to promote STEM awareness within the community. This involved traveling to local elementary schools to do hands-on demonstrations about basic programming of robots with the students and teach them basic coding skills.  As part of the design team, I worked with other members of my team to make decisions and work to form a consensus on the mechanical design of the robot. We would work with the programmers to come up with a design for the robot that would work best for it to be able to maneuver around the obstacles.
